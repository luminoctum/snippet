# SNIPPET
This is a collection of small python subroutines that demonstrate the use of 
handy functions

* Calling executable files from python,
the library is:
[*subprocess*](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess)

* Parallel executation,
the library is:
[*multiprocess*](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html)

The above two functions are demonstrated in the code
[parallel\_grs\_ammonia\_grid.py](https://github.com/luminoctum/snippet/blob/a90ca1fffef759d5bcc89d54689dbea6eb6015a8/parallel_grs_ammonia_grid.py)
